# customer_purchase_behaviour_Data-Analysis-project

Overview
This project aims to analyze customer purchase behavior using a dataset that includes various features related to the customers and their purchasing patterns. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on their characteristics and interactions with the website. This analysis can provide valuable insights for businesses to enhance their marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and ultimately increase sales.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

Age: The age of the customer.
Gender: The gender of the customer (encoded as integers).
AnnualIncome: The annual income of the customer in currency units.
NumberOfPurchases: The number of purchases made by the customer.
ProductCategory: The category of the products purchased by the customer (encoded as integers).
TimeSpentOnWebsite: The total time (in minutes) spent by the customer on the website.
LoyaltyProgram: Indicates whether the customer is part of a loyalty program (encoded as integers).
DiscountsAvailed: The number of discounts availed by the customer.
PurchaseStatus: The target variable indicating whether the customer made a purchase (1) or not (0).
Objectives
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand the distribution and relationships between different features.
Visualize the data to gain insights into customer behavior.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features if necessary.
Model Training:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest Classifier) to predict purchase status.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.
Interpret the results to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.
Insights and Recommendations:

Draw meaningful conclusions from the analysis.
Provide actionable recommendations for improving customer engagement and increasing purchase rates.
Tools and Technologies
Python: The primary programming language used for analysis and modeling.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model building and evaluation.
Key Findings
Customer Demographics: Insights into how age, gender, and income levels affect purchasing behavior.
Website Interaction: Analysis of how the time spent on the website influences the likelihood of making a purchase.
Loyalty Programs and Discounts: Understanding the impact of loyalty programs and discounts on customer purchase decisions.
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer purchase behavior using machine learning techniques. The insights gained from this analysis can help businesses tailor their strategies to better meet customer needs, ultimately driving higher conversion rates and improving overall customer satisfaction.
